# cat-contest
## A demo with React and serverless architecture (AWS)

In this demo, we make an intensive use of services provided by AWS for serverless architecture : 

- Lambda
- API Gateway
- Cognito 
- DynamoDB
- SQS  
- CloudFront
- Rekognition (we will prevent our users to upload non-cat images with a pre-validation based on image rekognition)
